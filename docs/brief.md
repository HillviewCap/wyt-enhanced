# **Project Brief: ISR Platform**

### **Executive Summary**

This project will develop a next-generation, cloud-native ISR platform for multi-protocol wireless analysis. The primary problem is that existing open-source tools are limited to single protocols (like Wi-Fi), lack enterprise scalability, and present significant deployment complexity, creating a barrier for security professionals. Our platform will provide a unified, easy-to-deploy solution that ingests data from Kismet, Software Defined Radio (SDR), and other sources, offering AI-powered analytics through a comprehensive API. The key value proposition is to deliver an accessible, scalable, and integration-ready ISR tool that surpasses the capabilities of current niche solutions.

### **Problem Statement**

Modern ISR and security operations require comprehensive, multi-protocol wireless signal analysis, but current tools force a trade-off between limited, hard-to-deploy open-source projects and prohibitively expensive commercial platforms. This siloed approach prevents the **fusion of multi-protocol data**, making it impossible to correlate threats across different spectra—such as linking a persistent Wi-Fi device to a cellular signal captured via SDR—on a single, unified geospatial view.  
Existing solutions, like "Chasing-Your-Tail-NG," suffer from **severe architectural limitations**. These monolithic, desktop-bound designs are incapable of supporting **distributed, multi-sensor deployments** (i.e., 'swarms'), preventing the creation of a real-time, wide-area surveillance picture and limiting operations to a single, localized sensor. Furthermore, their **prohibitive setup complexity**—requiring hours of manual configuration and deep Linux expertise—creates a significant barrier to adoption, limiting powerful counter-surveillance capabilities to a small niche of experts. This leaves a critical, unaddressed gap for a scalable, accessible, and integration-ready platform that can meet the demands of modern threat environments.  
\<hr\>

### **Proposed Solution**

We will develop a modular, cloud-native ISR platform designed for multi-protocol data fusion and distributed sensor networks. The core of the solution is a microservices-based architecture that can be deployed effortlessly via containers, either in the cloud for large-scale operations or on edge devices (like Raspberry Pis) for field use.  
Our key differentiators will be:

* **Multi-Protocol Ingestion**: A unified ingestion API will support Kismet logs (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) and integrate directly with Software Defined Radio (SDR) frameworks, enabling comprehensive spectrum analysis.  
* **"RF Fusion" Display**: A single, time-synchronized geospatial interface will fuse and display all ingested data, allowing analysts to visually correlate threats across different wireless protocols in real-time.  
* **"Swarm" Deployments**: The platform will be architected to support networks of distributed, low-cost sensors, feeding data to a central dashboard for real-time, wide-area monitoring.  
* **API-First Design**: A comprehensive REST API and webhook support will be a core feature, enabling seamless integration with SIEMs, existing security infrastructure, and custom applications.

This solution will succeed by directly addressing the critical failures of existing tools. By embracing a modern, scalable architecture and prioritizing ease of deployment and integration, we will lower the barrier to entry for advanced ISR capabilities. The high-level vision is to create an accessible, powerful, and extensible platform that democratizes multi-spectrum intelligence analysis for security professionals.

### **Target Users**

#### **Primary User Segment: The Enterprise & Government Security Analyst**

* **Profile**: This user is a technical security professional working within a government intelligence unit, military branch, or an enterprise Security Operations Center (SOC). They are tasked with ensuring the security of physical locations, events, or personnel against wireless threats.  
* **Current Behaviors**: They currently rely on a fragmented set of specialized, often disconnected, tools for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and radio analysis. A significant portion of their time is spent manually correlating data from these different sources and dealing with complex hardware and software configurations for each new deployment.  
* **Needs & Pain Points**: Their primary need is a **unified, scalable, and integrable view of the RF spectrum**. They are frustrated by the lack of tools that can fuse multi-protocol data in real-time and support distributed sensor networks for wide-area monitoring. The inability to easily feed intelligence into their central SIEM or reporting dashboards is a major workflow bottleneck.  
* **Goals**: To rapidly detect, analyze, correlate, and report on sophisticated wireless threats across a wide operational area, and to integrate this intelligence into their organization's broader security posture.

#### **Secondary User Segment: The Independent Security Researcher / Privacy Advocate**

* **Profile**: This is a highly technical individual, such as a penetration tester, security consultant, journalist, or a privacy-conscious person in a high-risk environment. They are budget-conscious and often leverage portable, low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pis.  
* **Current Behaviors**: This user is proficient with tools like Kismet but struggles with their steep learning curve, hardware compatibility issues, and complex setup processes. They are the core audience for existing tools like "Chasing-Your-Tail-NG."  
* **Needs & Pain Points**: They need powerful, affordable, and portable surveillance detection capabilities. Their main frustration is the excessive time and effort required to set up and maintain a reliable monitoring toolkit, which detracts from their primary analysis tasks.  
* **Goals**: To effectively and affordably detect and analyze potential surveillance threats in their immediate environment without being burdened by excessive setup and hardware constraints.

\<hr\>

### **Goals & Success Metrics**

#### **Business Objectives**

* Achieve significant adoption within the open-source security community by launching a superior alternative to existing tools, targeting 1,000 GitHub stars within 12 months of public release.  
* Establish a foundation for a future enterprise offering by ensuring a clear architectural separation between the core open-source platform and potential commercial features by the end of the MVP development.

#### **User Success Metrics**

* **Drastically Reduce Setup Time**: Reduce the median time from initial download to first data visualization from an estimated 4+ hours with current tools to under 15 minutes for a containerized deployment.  
* **Enable Advanced Analysis**: Achieve a \>90% user satisfaction rating in post-MVP surveys specifically on the "RF Fusion" and distributed "Swarm" monitoring capabilities, validating that we are enabling analysis impossible with other tools.

#### **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

* **Deployment Success Rate**: Target a \>95% success rate for first-time automated deployments on all officially supported platforms (e.g., Docker, Raspberry Pi).  
* **Active Installations**: Aim for 500 active weekly installations (tracked via a voluntary, non-intrusive check-in) within 6 months of launch.  
* **API Integration Rate**: Track the number of unique, active API keys to measure platform integration. Target 100 active API integrators within the first year.

\<hr\>

### **MVP Scope**

#### **Core Features (Must Have)**

* **Containerized Deployment**: The entire platform (backend service and web UI) must be deployable via a single docker-compose up command, achieving the goal of a sub-15-minute setup.  
* **Dual-Protocol Ingestion**: The system must support data ingestion from at least two sources to validate the core "fusion" concept:  
  1. **Kismet**: Process existing Kismet SQLite logs for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth data.  
  2. **Basic SDR**: Provide a connector for one common SDR type (e.g., RTL-SDR) to capture and process raw signal data in a specific frequency band (e.g., cellular or LoRa).  
* **Basic "RF Fusion" Map UI**: A simple, web-based geospatial map that can simultaneously display and filter data points from both Kismet and the SDR source. This demonstrates the core value proposition over single-protocol tools.  
* **Core Persistence Analysis**: Implement a simplified version of the persistence scoring algorithm from "Chasing-Your-Tail-NG" that works on the fused dataset.  
* **Data Export API**: A basic, documented REST API endpoint that allows a user to export the processed, correlated data in JSON format.

#### **Out of Scope for MVP**

* **"Swarm Intelligence" Mode**: Multi-sensor coordination and mesh networking will be a post-MVP feature. The MVP will focus on a single, powerful node.  
* **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: The MVP will use proven, rule-based detection algorithms. The machine learning layer is a key V2 feature.  
* **Advanced SDR & Protocol Support**: Support for additional SDR hardware, protocols (Zigbee, etc.), and advanced signal processing will be added after the MVP.  
* **Enterprise Features**: Multi-user support, role-based access control (RBAC), advanced reporting, and direct SIEM connectors are out of scope for the initial release.  
* **GUI-Based Configuration**: All configuration will be handled via simple text files (e.g., YAML or .env files). A full configuration UI is not part of the MVP.

#### **MVP Success Criteria**

The MVP will be considered successful if:

1. A target user can deploy the platform and visualize their first set of fused Kismet & SDR data on the map in under 15 minutes.  
2. The platform can successfully identify and score a persistent device across at least two locations using the fused dataset.  
3. An external script can successfully retrieve the analysis results via the public REST API endpoint.

\<hr\>

### **Post-MVP Vision**

#### **Phase 2 Features (Next Priorities)**

* **"Swarm Intelligence" Mode**: Introduce support for distributed, multi-sensor deployments, allowing users to aggregate data from a network of low-cost nodes into a single, unified operational picture.  
* **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: Integrate a machine learning layer to move beyond rule-based analysis. This will enable the platform to learn RF baselines and automatically detect novel or anomalous signal behavior.  
* **Expanded SDR & Protocol Support**: Broaden support for a wider range of SDR hardware and add ingestion capabilities for other wireless protocols (e.g., Zigbee, LoRaWAN).

#### **Long-term Vision (1-2 Years)**

The long-term vision is to evolve from a specialized tool into a comprehensive, enterprise-ready ISR platform. This includes building out a rich plugin ecosystem via the API, allowing third parties to contribute new data sources or analytical modules. The goal is to become the go-to open-source solution for multi-spectrum intelligence analysis.

#### **Expansion Opportunities**

* **Commercial Enterprise Tier**: A potential future offering could include features like advanced reporting, multi-user role-based access control (RBAC), direct SIEM integration, and dedicated enterprise support.  
* **Cross-Discipline Intelligence Fusion**: Expand beyond SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) to allow for integration with other intelligence sources, such as OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) feeds, for richer contextual analysis.

\<hr\>

### **Technical Considerations**

#### **Platform Requirements**

* **Target Platforms**: The platform must be **Linux-based** for sensor deployment (including on edge devices like Raspberry Pi), but the primary user interface will be a **cross-platform, responsive web application**.  
* **Performance Requirements**: The system should be designed for **real-time stream processing** of ingested data, with a goal of near sub-second latency for threat correlation and visualization.

#### **Technology Preferences**

* **Frontend**: A modern web framework (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte) capable of handling real-time data visualization on interactive maps.  
* **Backend**: A **cloud-native microservices architecture** is strongly preferred over a monolith. A high-performance language/framework (e.g., Go, Rust, or Python with FastAPI/Starlette) is recommended to handle data-intensive processing.  
* **Database**: A scalable database capable of handling time-series and geospatial data is required (e.g., PostgreSQL with PostGIS/TimescaleDB, InfluxDB). SQLite is not suitable for the production environment.  
* **Hosting/Infrastructure**: The architecture should be **container-native (Docker/Kubernetes)** and deployable to major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP).

#### **Architecture Considerations**

* **Repository Structure**: A **Monorepo** is suggested to manage shared code (e.g., data types) between the frontend, backend services, and ingestion modules.  
* **Service Architecture**: A **microservices architecture** is required to ensure scalability, resilience, and independent deployment of components (e.g., Kismet ingestion service, SDR service, analysis service).  
* **Integration Requirements**: A **REST API** is mandatory for integration with external tools like SIEMs.  
* **Security/Compliance**: The system must build upon the strong security foundations observed in the competitor (e.g., no SQL injection, secure credential management) and be designed to support future enterprise security features like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

\<hr\>

### **Constraints & Assumptions**

#### **Constraints**

* **Budget**: The project will operate with a minimal budget, prioritizing the use of open-source software and free-tier cloud services for the MVP to ensure accessibility.  
* **Timeline**: The timeline is aggressive, with the MVP scope defined to accelerate the initial public launch and gather community feedback as quickly as possible. A specific release date is yet to be determined.  
* **Resources**: The primary development resources are the AI agent team directed by the project lead. The project will be structured to encourage and facilitate open-source community contributions post-launch.  
* **Technical**: The MVP's sensor software must run effectively on common, low-cost hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4/5, common RTL-SDR dongles) to maximize accessibility for our target users.

#### **Key Assumptions**

* **Community Engagement**: We assume that a well-architected, easy-to-deploy, and powerful open-source platform will attract community contributors for post-MVP feature development and maintenance.  
* **Hardware Accessibility**: We assume that our target users are willing and able to purchase a small set of clearly specified, affordable hardware components to act as sensors.  
* **Kismet Viability**: We assume Kismet will continue to be a stable, maintained, and effective tool for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth data collection.  
* **Edge Performance**: We assume that modern, low-cost edge devices (like a Raspberry Pi 5\) have sufficient computational power to handle real-time data ingestion and pre-processing.

\<hr\>

### **Risks & Open Questions**

#### **Key Risks**

* **Technical Complexity Risk**: The core value proposition of "RF Fusion" (ingesting and synchronizing Kismet and SDR data in real-time) is technically complex. Unforeseen challenges in data processing and hardware integration could delay the MVP.  
* **User Adoption Risk**: Our success hinges on being dramatically easier to deploy than existing tools. If the containerized setup encounters common hardware or driver compatibility issues on user systems, we could fail to overcome the primary adoption barrier.  
* **Community Engagement Risk**: The post-MVP vision relies on attracting open-source contributors. If the initial product isn't compelling enough or the architecture is too difficult to contribute to, the project may stagnate.

#### **Open Questions**

* Which specific SDR frequency bands (e.g., cellular, LoRa, etc.) are the most critical to support in the MVP to provide immediate, high-value intelligence?  
* What is the most intuitive data visualization model for the "RF Fusion" map that avoids overwhelming users with too much information?  
* What are the top 3-5 most critical API endpoints needed for a meaningful integration with a standard SIEM or other security dashboards?

#### **Areas Needing Further Research**

* A survey of the most popular low-cost SDR dongles to determine the best initial hardware target for the MVP, focusing on driver stability and performance in a containerized Linux environment.  
* Performance benchmarking on the Raspberry Pi 5 to confirm it can handle the processing load of our dual-protocol ingestion MVP.
