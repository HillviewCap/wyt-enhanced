# Story 1.5: Geospatial Map UI

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Security Analyst,
**I want** to see a web-based geospatial map,
**so that** I have a canvas for visualizing device location data.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The frontend application integrates a mapping library (e.g., Leaflet, Mapbox).
2. The UI displays a full-screen, interactive map that users can pan and zoom.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.4 - API for Analysis Results]

Story 1.4 successfully implemented the GET /api/analysis/results endpoint that this frontend will consume in Story 1.6. Key details:
- Endpoint: GET /api/analysis/results
- Query parameter: min_persistence_score (optional, 0.0-1.0)
- Returns array of devices with persistence scores, locations, and timestamps
- Response includes aggregated sighting locations (deduplicated by lat/lon)
- All timestamps in ISO 8601 format

### Frontend Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- **Frontend Language**: TypeScript ~5.4 (currently in use)
- **Frontend Framework**: React ~18.2 (currently in use)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS ~3.4 (already configured)
- **Build Tool**: Vite ~5.2 (already configured)

**Note**: Shadcn/ui and Zustand are listed in the tech stack document but are NOT currently installed. They will be added in future stories when needed for complex UI components and state management.

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

Frontend application structure:
```
isr-platform/apps/isr-app/
├── src/
│   ├── app/
│   │   ├── components/   # UI components (CREATE THIS)
│   │   ├── routes/       # Page components (future)
│   │   └── services/     # API clients (future)
│   └── main.tsx          # Entry point (exists)
```

New files should be created in:
- `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/map/` - Map-related components
- `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/ui/` - General UI components

### Mapping Library Selection
[Source: Epic requirements suggest Leaflet or Mapbox]

**Recommended: Leaflet with React-Leaflet**
- Open source, no API key required for basic maps
- React-Leaflet provides React component wrappers
- Well-documented and widely used
- Supports all required features (pan, zoom, markers, overlays)

**Installation commands:**
```bash
npm install leaflet react-leaflet
npm install --save-dev @types/leaflet
```

### Map Configuration
[Source: Story requirements and common patterns]

**Default map settings:**
- Center: Should be configurable, suggest [40.7128, -74.0060] (NYC) as default
- Default zoom: 11-13 for city-level view
- Min zoom: 2 (world view)
- Max zoom: 18 (street level detail)
- Tile provider: OpenStreetMap (free, no API key)

**Leaflet CSS Import:**
Add to main.tsx or index.css:
```css
@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

### Component Structure
[Source: React patterns and project structure]

**MapView.tsx structure:**
```typescript
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, ZoomControl } from 'react-leaflet';
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';

interface MapViewProps {
  // Future props for data points
}

export function MapView(props: MapViewProps) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Styling Approach
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md - Tailwind CSS]

- Use Tailwind CSS classes for component styling
- Full-screen map: `className="h-screen w-screen"`
- Overlay panels: `className="absolute z-[400] bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-4"`
- Ensure z-index values work with Leaflet's defaults (map tiles are z-index 200-400)

### Current Frontend State
[Source: Current codebase inspection]

- App.tsx currently shows "Hello World" - needs to be replaced
- Tailwind CSS is configured and working (seen in current App.tsx)
- No existing components directory - needs to be created
- TypeScript and React are properly configured
- Vite dev server available via `nx serve isr-app`

### Placeholder Component Specifications
[Source: Story requirements for MVP]

**FilterPanel.tsx (Placeholder):**
- Minimal functional component that renders a visible panel
- Should display text "Filter Panel (Coming Soon)" or similar
- Styled as a white overlay panel with shadow
- No interactive functionality required at this stage
- Example structure:
```typescript
export function FilterPanel() {
  return (
    <div className="absolute top-4 left-4 z-[1000] bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-4">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Filters</h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Coming in Story 1.6</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**TimelineControl.tsx (Placeholder):**
- Minimal functional component that renders a visible control bar
- Should display text "Timeline Control (Coming Soon)" or similar
- Positioned at bottom of screen as a horizontal bar
- No interactive functionality required at this stage
- Example structure:
```typescript
export function TimelineControl() {
  return (
    <div className="absolute bottom-4 left-4 right-4 z-[1000] bg-white shadow-lg rounded-lg p-4">
      <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold">Timeline</h3>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">Coming in Story 1.6</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Testing
[Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md, existing test patterns from Story 1.4]

**Test Standards:**
- Testing Framework: Jest with ts-jest transformer
- Test Runner: `nx test isr-app`
- Test File Location: Same directory as component with `.spec.tsx` extension
- Test File Naming: `{ComponentName}.spec.tsx`
- Coverage Requirement: Minimum 80% code coverage for UI components
- Mock Strategy: Mock external dependencies (Leaflet, react-leaflet) not component logic

**Testing Patterns for React Components:**
```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { MapView } from './MapView';

// Mock react-leaflet at module level
jest.mock('react-leaflet', () => ({
  MapContainer: jest.fn(({ children }) => <div data-testid="map-container">{children}</div>),
  TileLayer: jest.fn(() => <div data-testid="tile-layer" />),
  ZoomControl: jest.fn(() => <div data-testid="zoom-control" />),
}));

describe('MapView', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  it('should render map container with correct props', () => {
    render(<MapView />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('map-container')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });

  it('should render zoom controls', () => {
    render(<MapView />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('zoom-control')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

**Leaflet-Specific Mocking:**
Leaflet requires DOM and window objects. Use these mocks in test setup:
```typescript
// Mock Leaflet global
global.L = {
  Icon: {
    Default: {
      mergeOptions: jest.fn(),
    },
  },
};

// Mock window.matchMedia for responsive components
Object.defineProperty(window, 'matchMedia', {
  writable: true,
  value: jest.fn().mockImplementation(query => ({
    matches: false,
    media: query,
    onchange: null,
    addListener: jest.fn(),
    removeListener: jest.fn(),
    addEventListener: jest.fn(),
    removeEventListener: jest.fn(),
    dispatchEvent: jest.fn(),
  })),
});
```

**Test Coverage Areas:**
1. Component Rendering: All components render without errors
2. Props Handling: Components accept and use props correctly
3. User Interactions: Click handlers for reset button work
4. Layout/Positioning: Overlays positioned correctly with z-index
5. Error Boundaries: Components handle missing data gracefully

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates good React patterns with proper component separation and TypeScript usage. The code is clean, well-structured, and follows modern React best practices with hooks (useRef, useCallback). The map integration using Leaflet and React-Leaflet wrapper is appropriate for the requirements. However, there is a **critical dependency issue**: the required npm packages (leaflet, react-leaflet, @types/leaflet) are not actually installed in package.json despite the story claiming they are.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed as the code quality is good. The main issue is missing dependencies rather than code structure.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows TypeScript and React best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized in app/components/map and app/components/ui
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test suite with good mocking strategy
- All ACs Met: ✗ AC#1 not met - mapping library not actually integrated (dependencies missing)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Install missing dependencies (leaflet, react-leaflet, @types/leaflet)
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Configure Jest test runner in nx.json or project.json
- [ ] Add error boundary for map component to handle loading failures gracefully
- [ ] Consider adding loading state while map tiles are fetching
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements (aria-labels for interactive elements)
- [x] Reset button has proper aria-label
- [x] Components use semantic HTML structure

### Security Review

- No API keys exposed ✓ (using OpenStreetMap free tiles)
- No sensitive data handling in this story ✓
- External dependency risk: Leaflet and React-Leaflet are well-maintained open source libraries ✓
- Content Security Policy may need adjustment for loading map tiles from external CDN

### Performance Considerations

- Map renders efficiently with React-Leaflet virtual DOM optimizations ✓
- Tile loading is handled by Leaflet's built-in tile management ✓
- Consider implementing lazy loading for the map component in future stories
- Z-index values (1000) are appropriately high to stay above map layers

### Files Modified During Review

None - Dependencies need to be installed first before any code improvements can be tested.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/1.5-geospatial-map-ui.yml
Risk profile: Not generated (critical dependency issue found)
NFR assessment: Partial (security and performance assessed, reliability blocked by missing deps)

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
**Critical Issue**: The story claims dependencies are installed but they are not present in package.json. The application cannot run as implemented. Tests cannot be executed without proper Jest configuration in nx workspace.
