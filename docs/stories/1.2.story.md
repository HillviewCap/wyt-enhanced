# Story 1.2: Multi-Log Kismet Ingestion Service

## Status
Needs Enhancement

## Story
**As a** Platform Operator,
**I want** to configure the system to ingest multiple Kismet SQLite files from ~/kismet_logs/ directory,
**so that** device and location data from all sources can be parsed, combined, and stored for unified analysis.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A backend service is created to handle the ingestion process for multiple Kismet files.
2. The service can be configured to process all .kismet files in the ~/kismet_logs/ directory.
3. Upon execution, the service correctly parses device, signal, and GPS data from multiple Kismet logs simultaneously or sequentially.
4. Duplicate device records across files are intelligently merged based on MAC address and temporal correlation.
5. Parsed data is correctly stored in the platform's database with source tracking, matching the enhanced data model.
6. The ingestion process logs its progress per file and reports any parsing errors with file attribution.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.1:
- Nx monorepo structure established with apps/api and apps/isr-app
- Docker compose includes PostgreSQL ~16 container with credentials in docker-compose.yml
- Express.js ~4.19 backend running with TypeScript
- Basic /health endpoint already implemented in apps/api/src/main.ts
- Type checking configured and working for backend

### Kismet Log Location
**IMPORTANT**: The Kismet log files for testing are located at: `/home/kali/kismet_logs/`

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Device Model:**
```typescript
export interface Device {
  id: string;
  macAddress: string;
  firstSeen: Date;
  lastSeen: Date;
}
```

**Enhanced Sighting Model:**
```typescript
export interface Sighting {
  id: string;
  deviceId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  signalStrength: number;
  sourceFileId: string;
  importedAt: Date;
  confidence: number;
}
```

**New KismetLogFile Model:**
```typescript
export interface KismetLogFile {
  id: string;
  filePath: string;
  fileName: string;
  fileSize: number;
  lastModified: Date;
  lastProcessed: Date;
  processingStatus: 'discovered' | 'processing' | 'completed' | 'error';
  recordsProcessed: number;
  errorMessage?: string;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**POST /api/datasources** - Create a new data source configuration
- Response: 201 Created

**POST /api/datasources/{id}/ingest** - Trigger ingestion process
- Parameters: id (path, required, string)
- Response: 202 Accepted (ingestion process started)

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

New files should be created in these locations:
```
apps/api/src/app/
├── routes/          # API endpoint controllers
│   └── datasources.routes.ts
├── services/        # Business logic
│   └── kismet-ingestion.service.ts
└── data-access/     # Data access layer (using Prisma)
    ├── device.repository.ts
    ├── sighting.repository.ts
    └── index.ts
```

Prisma files:
```
apps/api/
├── prisma/
│   └── schema.prisma
```

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Database ORM: Prisma ~5.12 (provides type safety between database and application)
- Database: PostgreSQL ~16 (already running in Docker container)
- Backend: Node.js ~20.11, Express.js ~4.19, TypeScript ~5.4

### Technical Constraints
- PostgreSQL container already configured in docker-compose.yml from Story 1.1
- Must use Prisma ORM for all database operations
- All TypeScript interfaces must be shared via libs/data-models
- API must follow OpenAPI specification format from architecture docs
- Ingestion should handle large Kismet files efficiently using batch operations

### Testing
No specific testing guidance found in architecture docs. Implement unit tests following standard Jest patterns used in Nx workspaces.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-29

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with proper separation of concerns, appropriate use of TypeScript, and comprehensive data access patterns. The service correctly handles Kismet SQLite file parsing and data transformation. However, critical security vulnerabilities were identified and remediated during review.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: apps/api/src/app/routes/datasources.routes.ts
  - **Change**: Added path traversal protection and directory restriction
  - **Why**: Critical security vulnerability - unrestricted file system access
  - **How**: Implemented path normalization and validation to restrict access to /home/kali/kismet_logs directory only

- **File**: apps/api/src/app/data-access/device.repository.ts
  - **Change**: Improved upsert logic for firstSeen timestamp handling
  - **Why**: Original implementation incorrectly overwrote firstSeen on every update
  - **How**: Added conditional logic to only update firstSeen when new timestamp is earlier

- **File**: apps/api/src/app/services/kismet-ingestion.service.ts
  - **Change**: Added MAC address format validation
  - **Why**: Missing input validation could cause data integrity issues
  - **How**: Added regex validation for MAC address format before processing

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript properly utilized, consistent formatting
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows Nx monorepo patterns correctly
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests present with good coverage of transformation logic
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Requirements Traceability

**AC1: Backend service created** ✓
- KismetIngestionService class implemented
- Service properly instantiated and exported

**AC2: Configurable with Kismet file path** ✓
- POST /api/datasources endpoint accepts filePath configuration
- Path validation and security restrictions added

**AC3: Correctly parses device, signal, and GPS data** ✓
- SQLite queries extract all required fields
- Transformation functions handle data correctly
- Test coverage: transformKismetDevice and transformKismetSighting tests

**AC4: Data stored matching defined model** ✓
- Prisma schema matches required Device/Sighting interfaces
- Repository pattern properly implemented
- Upsert logic handles duplicate devices correctly

**AC5: Logging and error reporting** ✓
- Structured logging with timestamps throughout
- Error handling in all critical paths
- Progress reporting during batch processing

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed critical path traversal vulnerability in file path handling
- [x] Improved device upsert logic for proper firstSeen handling
- [x] Added MAC address format validation
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting to ingestion endpoints
- [ ] Add integration tests for full ingestion workflow
- [ ] Consider implementing ingestion status persistence in database
- [ ] Add metrics/telemetry for monitoring ingestion performance

### Security Review

**Critical Issues Found and Fixed:**
- Path traversal vulnerability allowing arbitrary file system access - FIXED
- Now restricted to /home/kali/kismet_logs directory only

**Remaining Considerations:**
- Rate limiting should be added to prevent DoS attacks
- Consider adding authentication/authorization to API endpoints
- File size limits should be implemented

### Performance Considerations

- Batch processing implemented (100 devices per batch) - Good approach
- Async processing with 202 Accepted response - Properly implemented
- In-memory data source storage adequate for POC but needs database persistence for production
- Consider adding progress tracking for large files

### Files Modified During Review

- apps/api/src/app/routes/datasources.routes.ts
- apps/api/src/app/data-access/device.repository.ts
- apps/api/src/app/services/kismet-ingestion.service.ts

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-kismet-log-ingestion-service.yml
Risk Level: Medium (security issues found but fixed)
Quality Score: 85/100

### Recommended Status
