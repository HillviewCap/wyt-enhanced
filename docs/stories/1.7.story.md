# Story 1.7: Frontend Navigation and Data Management UI

## Status
Ready for Review

## Epic Context
This is an enhancement story that extends Epic 1 to provide the missing frontend infrastructure components needed for a complete user workflow. While not originally defined in Epic 1 (Stories 1.1-1.6), this story addresses critical UI gaps identified after Story 1.6 completion.

## Story
**As a** Security Analyst,
**I want** navigation and UI components to configure data sources and trigger ingestion,
**so that** I can manage the complete workflow from data configuration through ingestion to visualization.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. React Router is configured with proper routes for Map View and Data Sources sections.
2. A persistent navigation bar allows users to navigate between different sections of the application.
3. A Data Sources page allows users to configure Kismet file paths and trigger ingestion.
4. The existing Map View is integrated into the routing system as the default/home route.
5. All pages maintain consistent styling using the established Tailwind CSS design system.
6. API calls from new UI components properly handle loading states and errors.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.6 (Status: done), the following infrastructure is already in place:
- ApiService.ts exists at `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/services/ApiService.ts`
- Zustand store configured at `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/stores/analysisStore.ts`
- MapView component fully functional with device display and filtering
- FilterPanel and TimelineControl components exist at `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/ui/`
- Testing infrastructure is in place based on the patterns used in Story 1.6

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**GET /api/datasources endpoint:**
- Returns list of configured data sources
- Response: JSON array of data source objects
- Status codes: 200 (success)

**POST /api/datasources endpoint:**
- Creates new data source configuration
- Request body: JSON with file path and configuration
- Response: 201 Created with data source ID
- Status codes: 201 (created), 400 (bad request)

**POST /api/datasources/{id}/ingest endpoint:**
- Triggers ingestion for specific data source
- Path parameter: data source ID (string)
- Response: 202 Accepted (async process started)
- Status codes: 202 (accepted), 404 (data source not found)

### Component Specifications

**File Locations:**
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- Route components: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/routes/`
- UI components: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/ui/`
- Services: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/services/`
- Stores: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/stores/`

**React Router v6 Patterns:**
```typescript
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, NavLink } from 'react-router-dom';

// Route configuration
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<MapView />} />
  <Route path="/map" element={<MapView />} />
  <Route path="/datasources" element={<DataSourcesPage />} />
  <Route path="/analysis" element={<AnalysisPage />} />
</Routes>
```

**NavLink Active Styling:**
```typescript
<NavLink 
  to="/map" 
  className={({ isActive }) => 
    isActive ? "text-blue-500 font-semibold" : "text-gray-700"
  }
>
  Map View
</NavLink>
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- React ~18.2 with functional components and hooks
- TypeScript ~5.4 for type safety
- Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for styling
- Shadcn/ui ~0.8 for UI components
- Zustand ~4.5 for state management
- React Router v6 for client-side routing

### UI/UX Requirements
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md]

**Navigation Bar Design:**
- Thin, persistent bar at the top with application title
- Located in top navigation as per spec
- Professional dark theme with #121212 background
- Text color #EAEAEA for primary text
- Interactive elements use #00BFFF (secondary color)

**Page Layout Patterns:**
- Progressive disclosure - start with high-level view
- Data-first, action second principle
- Loading states must be non-intrusive (subtle spinners)
- Error states must be clear but not alarming
- All interactions should provide feedback within 100ms

**Responsive Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: default
- Tablet: 768px
- Desktop: 1024px
- Wide: 1440px

### Project Structure Notes
New routes directory needs to be created at `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/routes/` to house page-level components. This aligns with the project structure but represents a new organizational pattern for the frontend.

## Testing

**Test Standards:**
Based on patterns from Story 1.6 implementation:
- Test Runner: `nx test isr-app`
- Test File Location: Same directory as component with `.spec.tsx` or `.spec.ts` extension
- Test File Naming: `{ComponentName}.spec.tsx` or `{ServiceName}.spec.ts`
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, routing) not component logic
- Use React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock fetch globally for API service tests

**React Router Testing Pattern:**
```typescript
import { MemoryRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
import { render } from '@testing-library/react';

// Wrap components in MemoryRouter for testing
render(
  <MemoryRouter initialEntries={['/datasources']}>
    <AppRouter />
  </MemoryRouter>
);
```

**API Service Testing Pattern (from Story 1.6):**
```typescript
// Mock fetch globally
global.fetch = jest.fn();

describe('ApiService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    (global.fetch as jest.Mock).mockClear();
  });

  it('should fetch data sources successfully', async () => {
    const mockData = [{ id: '123', path: '/path/to/kismet.db' }];
    (global.fetch as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({
      ok: true,
      json: async () => mockData,
    });

    const result = await ApiService.fetchDataSources();
    expect(result).toEqual(mockData);
  });
});
```

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates good architecture and follows React best practices. The routing infrastructure is properly configured with React Router v6, and the Data Sources management page provides comprehensive CRUD functionality. All 6 acceptance criteria have been fully met with appropriate test coverage. The dark theme design system is consistently applied across all new components.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/services/ApiService.ts
  - **Change**: Extracted baseUrl determination into a static getBaseUrl() method
  - **Why**: The original inline conditional made the ApiService untestable due to window.location.hostname being evaluated at module load time
  - **How**: This refactoring allows proper mocking in tests while maintaining the same runtime behavior for determining API endpoints

- **File**: isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/services/ApiService.spec.ts  
  - **Change**: Added proper mocking for the getBaseUrl method and baseUrl property
  - **Why**: Tests were failing because they expected '/api' but the service was using 'http://localhost:3001/api' due to unmocked window.location
  - **How**: The mock ensures consistent test behavior by forcing '/api' as the base URL in all test scenarios

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ TypeScript interfaces properly defined, functional components with hooks
- Project Structure: ✓ Follows the established pattern with routes/, components/, services/ directories
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with React Testing Library
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 6 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed failing ApiService tests by refactoring baseUrl determination
- [x] Ensured consistent test behavior across all environments
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for the complete data source workflow
- [ ] Add error boundary around DataSourcesPage for better error handling
- [ ] Consider implementing retry logic for failed API calls
- [ ] Add loading skeleton components instead of just spinners for better UX

### Security Review

No critical security issues found. The application properly validates file paths on the frontend, though backend validation should also be verified. API error messages are properly sanitized before display to users.

### Performance Considerations

The refreshKey pattern in DataSourcesPage causes full re-fetches. Consider implementing more granular state updates or using optimistic UI updates for better performance. The current implementation is acceptable for MVP but could be optimized for production use.
