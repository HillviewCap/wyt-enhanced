# Story 1.4: API for Analysis Results

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Frontend Developer,
**I want** a REST API endpoint to retrieve the results of the persistence analysis,
**so that** I can display the data in the user interface.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new GET endpoint (e.g., /api/analysis/results) is created on the backend service.
2. The endpoint returns a collection of tracked devices and their analysis data (including persistence score, locations, and timestamps) in a structured JSON format.
3. The API includes basic filtering capabilities (e.g., by persistence score threshold).
4. The API endpoint is documented using OpenAPI (Swagger) standards.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create GET /api/analysis/results endpoint (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Add route handler in isr-platform/apps/api/src/app/routes/datasources.routes.ts
  - [x] Define request query parameters interface for filtering
  - [x] Implement response structure with device and analysis data
- [x] Implement data retrieval logic (AC: 2)
  - [x] Use AnalysisResultRepository.findWithDevices() method to get results with device data
  - [x] For each result, query sightings using deviceId to get location data
  - [x] Structure response to include device MAC address, persistence score, first/last seen timestamps
  - [x] Include aggregated location data from associated sightings (group by unique lat/lon)
  - [x] Format timestamps in ISO 8601 format for consistency
- [x] Add filtering capabilities (AC: 3)
  - [x] Implement min_persistence_score query parameter filtering
  - [x] Validate query parameters (ensure min_persistence_score is between 0.0 and 1.0)
  - [x] Apply filters to database query before returning results
  - [x] Handle invalid filter values with appropriate 400 Bad Request responses

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
[Source: Story 1.3 - Backend Persistence Analysis Engine]

Story 1.3 successfully implemented the persistence analysis engine with the following key components that this story will build upon:
- **AnalysisResult Model Created**: Already exists in Prisma schema and libs/data-models
- **AnalysisResultRepository**: Created in isr-platform/apps/api/src/app/data-access/analysis-result.repository.ts with the following methods:
  - `create(data)`: Create new analysis result
  - `findWithDevices()`: Retrieve all analysis results with associated device data (USE THIS METHOD)
  - `findByDeviceId(deviceId)`: Get analysis for specific device
  - `deleteByDeviceId(deviceId)`: Remove analysis results
- **Analysis Trigger Endpoint**: POST /api/analysis/trigger already implemented in datasources.routes.ts

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md, Story 1.3 implementation]

**Existing Device Model:**
```typescript
export interface Device {
  id: string;
  macAddress: string;
  firstSeen: Date;
  lastSeen: Date;
}
```

**Existing Sighting Model:**
```typescript
export interface Sighting {
  id: string;
  deviceId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  signalStrength: number;
}
```

**Existing AnalysisResult Model (from Story 1.3):**
```typescript
export interface AnalysisResult {
  id: string;
  deviceId: string;
  persistenceScore: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  analysisTimestamp: Date;
  locationCount: number;
  timeWindowHours: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**GET /api/analysis/results** endpoint specification:
- Path: `/api/analysis/results`
- Method: GET
- Query Parameters:
  - `min_persistence_score` (optional, number, float): Filter devices by minimum persistence score (0.0-1.0)
- Response: 200 OK with JSON array of devices with their analysis results
- Response should include: device information, persistence score, sighting locations, timestamps

**Data Retrieval Strategy:**
1. Use `AnalysisResultRepository.findWithDevices()` to get analysis results with device info
2. For each result, query sightings table using deviceId to get location history
3. Aggregate sighting locations (group by unique lat/lon pairs)
4. Combine data into response structure

Expected Response Structure:
```json
[
  {
    "deviceId": "string",
    "macAddress": "string",
    "persistenceScore": 0.85,
    "firstSeen": "2025-08-30T10:00:00Z",
    "lastSeen": "2025-08-30T14:30:00Z",
    "locationCount": 3,
    "timeWindowHours": 24,
    "analysisTimestamp": "2025-08-30T15:00:00Z",
    "sightings": [
      {
        "latitude": 40.7128,
        "longitude": -74.0060,
        "timestamp": "2025-08-30T10:00:00Z",
        "signalStrength": -65
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md, Story 1.3 implementation]

**Existing files to modify:**
- `isr-platform/apps/api/src/app/routes/datasources.routes.ts` - Add GET /api/analysis/results endpoint here
- `docs/architecture/api-specification.md` - Update with complete endpoint documentation

**Existing files to use (already created in Story 1.3):**
- `isr-platform/apps/api/src/app/data-access/analysis-result.repository.ts` - Use findWithDevices() method
- `isr-platform/apps/api/src/app/data-access/index.ts` - Import prisma and repositories
- `isr-platform/libs/data-models/src/index.ts` - AnalysisResult interface already exists
- `isr-platform/apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma` - AnalysisResult model already defined

### REST API Patterns from Existing Code
[Source: Current implementation in datasources.routes.ts]

The project follows these patterns for API endpoints:
1. Use Express Router for route definitions
2. Implement try-catch blocks for error handling
3. Log with timestamps: `console.log(\`[${new Date().toISOString()}] INFO: ...\`)`
4. Return structured JSON responses with appropriate status codes
5. Validate input parameters before processing
6. Use async/await for database operations

Example pattern from existing code:
```typescript
router.get('/datasources', (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  try {
    // Implementation logic
    return res.status(200).json(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(`[${new Date().toISOString()}] ERROR: Failed to...`, error);
    return res.status(500).json({ error: 'Internal server error' });
  }
});
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, Story 1.3 implementation]
- Backend Framework: Express.js ~4.19 with TypeScript ~5.4
- Database ORM: Prisma ~5.12 (already configured)
- Database: PostgreSQL ~16
- Must use existing repository pattern established in Story 1.3
- Response size: Consider pagination for large result sets (future enhancement)

### Environment Configuration
No new environment variables needed - will use existing database connection from Story 1.3.

### Repository Methods to Use
[Source: isr-platform/apps/api/src/app/data-access/analysis-result.repository.ts]

**Primary Method:**
- `findWithDevices()`: Returns all analysis results with device data included via Prisma include

**For Sighting Data:**
- Use `prisma.sighting.findMany({ where: { deviceId: result.deviceId } })` to get locations
- Group sightings by unique lat/lon pairs to avoid duplicate locations in response

### Testing
[Source: Story 1.3 test patterns, architecture/testing-strategy.md]

**Test Standards:**
- Test file location: `isr-platform/apps/api/src/app/routes/datasources.routes.spec.ts`
- Testing framework: Jest with ts-jest transformer
- Test file naming: `*.spec.ts` for unit tests
- Coverage requirement: Minimum 80% code coverage for route handlers
- Mock strategy: Mock repository and Prisma calls, not HTTP requests

**Jest Configuration (from Story 1.3):**
Already configured in `isr-platform/apps/api/jest.config.js`

**Mock Patterns to Use:**
```typescript
// Mock the repository and prisma
jest.mock('../data-access', () => ({
  prisma: {
    analysisResult: {
      findMany: jest.fn(),
    },
    device: {
      findUnique: jest.fn(),
    },
    sighting: {
      findMany: jest.fn(),
    },
  },
  AnalysisResultRepository: {
    findWithDevices: jest.fn(),
  },
}));
```

**Test Cases to Implement:**
1. Test successful retrieval with no filters
2. Test filtering by min_persistence_score
3. Test invalid min_persistence_score values (negative, > 1.0, non-numeric)
4. Test empty result handling
5. Test database error handling
6. Test response structure matches specification
