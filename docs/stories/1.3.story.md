# Story 1.3: Backend Persistence Analysis Engine

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** Security Analyst,
**I want** the system to automatically analyze ingested Kismet data for persistent devices,
**so that** I can identify potential surveillance threats.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A backend analysis module is created that implements the persistence scoring algorithm.
2. The analysis correctly correlates device appearances across multiple locations and time windows.
3. Each tracked device is assigned a persistence score between 0.0 and 1.0.
4. The analysis results are stored in the database and linked to the relevant devices.
5. The engine can be triggered manually and processes a standard Kismet log within a predefined performance benchmark.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Story 1.2:
- Prisma ORM already set up with PostgreSQL database
- Device and Sighting models already exist and are populated by Kismet ingestion
- Repository pattern established in apps/api/src/app/data-access
- Batch processing pattern already implemented for efficient database operations
- Testing framework (Jest) configured and working
- Routes structure established in apps/api/src/app/routes

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Existing Device Model:**
```typescript
export interface Device {
  id: string;
  macAddress: string;
  firstSeen: Date;
  lastSeen: Date;
}
```

**Existing Sighting Model:**
```typescript
export interface Sighting {
  id: string;
  deviceId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  signalStrength: number;
}
```

**New AnalysisResult Model (to be created):**
```typescript
export interface AnalysisResult {
  id: string;
  deviceId: string;
  persistenceScore: number; // 0.0 to 1.0
  analysisTimestamp: Date;
  locationCount: number;
  timeWindowHours: number;
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**POST /api/analysis/trigger** - Trigger analysis process (new endpoint)
- Response: 202 Accepted (analysis process started)

**GET /api/analysis/results** - Get analysis results (to be implemented in Story 1.4)
- Parameters: min_persistence_score (query, optional, number)
- Response: 200 OK with list of devices and analysis results

### Persistence Scoring Algorithm
[Source: docs/brief.md - Core Persistence Analysis]

The persistence scoring algorithm from "Chasing-Your-Tail-NG" should:
1. Correlate device appearances across multiple locations
2. Analyze time patterns to identify devices that repeatedly appear
3. Consider proximity of locations (devices appearing at nearby locations score higher)
4. Factor in the frequency of appearances over time windows
5. Output a normalized score between 0.0 (not persistent) and 1.0 (highly persistent)

Key factors for scoring:
- Number of unique locations where device was seen
- Time consistency (appearing at regular intervals)
- Duration of monitoring (devices tracked over longer periods score higher)
- Signal strength patterns (consistent strong signals indicate closer proximity)

**Haversine Distance Implementation:**
Use the haversine formula to calculate distance between GPS coordinates:
```typescript
function haversineDistance(lat1: number, lon1: number, lat2: number, lon2: number): number {
  const R = 6371000; // Earth's radius in meters
  const φ1 = lat1 * Math.PI / 180;
  const φ2 = lat2 * Math.PI / 180;
  const Δφ = (lat2 - lat1) * Math.PI / 180;
  const Δλ = (lon2 - lon1) * Math.PI / 180;
  
  const a = Math.sin(Δφ/2) * Math.sin(Δφ/2) +
            Math.cos(φ1) * Math.cos(φ2) *
            Math.sin(Δλ/2) * Math.sin(Δλ/2);
  const c = 2 * Math.atan2(Math.sqrt(a), Math.sqrt(1-a));
  
  return R * c; // Distance in meters
}
```

### Project Structure
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

New files should be created in these locations:
```
apps/api/src/app/
├── services/
│   └── persistence-analysis.service.ts  # New analysis service
├── data-access/
│   └── analysis-result.repository.ts    # New repository for results
```

Updated Prisma schema location:
```
apps/api/prisma/schema.prisma  # Add AnalysisResult model here
```

### Technology Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Database ORM: Prisma ~5.12 (already configured)
- Database: PostgreSQL ~16 (already running)
- Backend: Node.js ~20.11, Express.js ~4.19, TypeScript ~5.4
- Testing: Jest (already configured from Story 1.2)

### Technical Constraints
- Must use existing Prisma setup and repository pattern from Story 1.2
- Analysis should run asynchronously to avoid blocking API responses
- Performance requirement: Process 10,000 devices with 50,000 sightings in under 30 seconds
- Scoring algorithm must output normalized values between 0.0 and 1.0
- Must handle large datasets efficiently using batch processing

### Configuration Management
Store analysis parameters in environment variables (apps/api/.env):
```
# Analysis Configuration
ANALYSIS_BATCH_SIZE=100
ANALYSIS_TIME_WINDOW_HOURS=24
ANALYSIS_PROXIMITY_RADIUS_METERS=100
ANALYSIS_MIN_SIGHTINGS_THRESHOLD=3
```

### Error Handling Specifications
- Wrap all database operations in try-catch blocks
- Log errors with context: `console.error('[PersistenceAnalysis] Error:', error.message)`
- Return partial results if some devices fail processing
- Store error count in analysis metadata
- Continue processing remaining devices on individual device failure

### Testing
[Source: Story 1.2 - apps/api/jest.config.js]

**Test File Locations:**
- Service tests: `apps/api/src/app/services/persistence-analysis.service.spec.ts`
- Repository tests: `apps/api/src/app/data-access/analysis-result.repository.spec.ts`

**Jest Configuration from Story 1.2:**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: '../../jest.preset.js',
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.[tj]s$': ['ts-jest', {
      tsconfig: '<rootDir>/tsconfig.spec.json',
    }],
  },
  moduleFileExtensions: ['ts', 'js', 'html'],
  coverageDirectory: '../../coverage/apps/api',
};
```

**Mock Patterns from Story 1.2:**
```typescript
// Mock Prisma Client
jest.mock('@prisma/client', () => ({
  PrismaClient: jest.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    device: {
      findMany: jest.fn(),
      upsert: jest.fn(),
    },
    sighting: {
      createMany: jest.fn(),
      findMany: jest.fn(),
    },
    analysisResult: {
      create: jest.fn(),
      findMany: jest.fn(),
    },
  })),
}));
```

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Minimum 80% code coverage for service layer
- 100% coverage for scoring algorithm core logic
- Test all edge cases: no sightings, single location, same timestamps
- Test batch processing with varying batch sizes
