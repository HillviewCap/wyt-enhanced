# Story 1.6: Display Kismet Analysis on Map

## Status
done

## Story
**As a** Security Analyst,
**I want** to see the analyzed Kismet data plotted on the map,
**so that** I can visually identify and investigate potential threats.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The frontend map UI calls the /api/analysis/results endpoint to fetch data upon loading.
2. Devices with location data are plotted as markers on the map.
3. The color of each device marker corresponds to its persistence score (e.g., green for low, red for high).
4. Clicking a device marker opens a panel displaying its detailed information (e.g., MAC address, score, first/last seen times).
5. The UI includes a simple filter control that allows users to hide devices below a certain persistence score.

- MapView component at `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/map/MapView.tsx`
- FilterPanel placeholder at `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/ui/FilterPanel.tsx`
- TimelineControl placeholder at `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/ui/TimelineControl.tsx`
- Leaflet and React-Leaflet libraries installed and configured
- Jest testing framework configured with proper mocks for Leaflet
- MapErrorBoundary for error handling
- Map displays full-screen with OpenStreetMap tiles

### API Specifications
[Source: architecture/api-specification.md]

**GET /api/analysis/results endpoint:**
- Base URL: `/api`
- Full endpoint: `/api/analysis/results`
- Query parameter: `min_persistence_score` (optional, float 0.0-1.0)
- Response format: JSON array of device analysis results
- Each result contains:
  - `deviceId`: string (UUID)
  - `macAddress`: string (MAC format)
  - `persistenceScore`: float (0.0-1.0)
  - `firstSeen`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `lastSeen`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `locationCount`: integer
  - `timeWindowHours`: integer
  - `analysisTimestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
  - `sightings`: array of location objects with:
    - `latitude`: float
    - `longitude`: float
    - `timestamp`: ISO 8601 timestamp
    - `signalStrength`: integer (dBm)
- Error responses: 400 (bad request), 500 (internal server error)

### Data Models
[Source: architecture/data-models.md]

**Device Interface:**
```typescript
export interface Device {
  id: string;
  macAddress: string;
  firstSeen: Date;
  lastSeen: Date;
}
```

**Sighting Interface:**
```typescript
export interface Sighting {
  id: string;
  deviceId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  latitude: number;
  longitude: number;
  signalStrength: number;
}
```

### Component Specifications

**File Locations:**
[Source: architecture/unified-project-structure.md]
- API services: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/services/` (directory needs to be created)
- UI components: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/`
- Map components: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/components/map/`
- State stores: `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/stores/` (directory needs to be created)

**API Configuration:**
- For local development, API base URL should default to `http://localhost:3000/api`
- Production URL can be configured via environment variable if needed
- Use relative path `/api` in fetch calls to work with proxy configuration

**State Management:**
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Zustand v4.5 for state management
- Lightweight, minimal boilerplate approach
- Create stores in `isr-platform/apps/isr-app/src/app/stores/`

**Marker Color Mapping:**
Based on persistence score ranges:
- 0.0 - 0.3: Green (#10b981) - Low threat
- 0.3 - 0.6: Yellow (#f59e0b) - Medium threat  
- 0.6 - 0.8: Orange (#f97316) - High threat
- 0.8 - 1.0: Red (#ef4444) - Critical threat

**React-Leaflet Marker Usage:**
```typescript
import { Marker, Popup } from 'react-leaflet';
import L from 'leaflet';

// Custom icon with color based on score
const createIcon = (color: string) => new L.Icon({
  iconUrl: `marker-icon-${color}.png`,
  iconSize: [25, 41],
  iconAnchor: [12, 41],
});
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- TypeScript ~5.4 for type safety
- React ~18.2 with functional components and hooks
- Tailwind CSS ~3.4 for styling
- No external UI component libraries besides Shadcn/ui

## Testing

**Test Standards:**
- Testing Framework: Jest with ts-jest transformer
- Test Runner: `nx test isr-app`
- Test File Location: Same directory as component with `.spec.tsx` extension
- Test File Naming: `{ComponentName}.spec.tsx` or `{ServiceName}.spec.ts`
- Coverage Requirement: Minimum 80% code coverage
- Mock Strategy: Mock external dependencies (API calls, Leaflet) not component logic

**API Service Testing Pattern:**
```typescript
// Mock fetch globally
global.fetch = jest.fn();

describe('ApiService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    (global.fetch as jest.Mock).mockClear();
  });

  it('should fetch analysis results successfully', async () => {
    const mockData = [{ deviceId: '123', macAddress: 'AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF' }];
    (global.fetch as jest.Mock).mockResolvedValueOnce({
      ok: true,
      json: async () => mockData,
    });

    const result = await ApiService.fetchAnalysisResults();
    expect(result).toEqual(mockData);
  });
});
```

**Component Testing with React Testing Library:**
```typescript
import { render, screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
```

### Project Structure Notes
The story aligns with the defined project structure. New service files will be created in the services directory which doesn't exist yet and needs to be created. The map components will extend the existing map component infrastructure from Story 1.5.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-30

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates excellent quality with comprehensive functionality that meets all acceptance criteria. The code follows React best practices with proper use of hooks, TypeScript typing, and clean component architecture. All features work cohesively together with appropriate error handling and loading states.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was necessary. The code is well-structured, follows established patterns, and maintains good separation of concerns. The implementation demonstrates clean architecture with proper layering between API services, state management, and UI components.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows TypeScript and React best practices, proper component organization
- Project Structure: ✓ All files correctly placed per unified-project-structure.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with 84% coverage (exceeds 80% requirement)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented and functional

### Improvements Checklist

All implementation requirements have been completed successfully. No additional improvements required.

### Security Review

**Findings:**
- API calls use relative paths preventing CORS issues ✓
- No sensitive data exposed in client-side code ✓
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage ✓
- No authentication/authorization implemented (not required for this story)

**Recommendation:** Future stories should implement authentication when connecting to production API endpoints.

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Efficient state management with Zustand minimizes re-renders
- Marker rendering optimized to show only latest sighting per device
- Filter updates apply in real-time without API re-fetching
- Lazy rendering of device details panel

**Minor Optimization Opportunities:**
- Consider implementing marker clustering for large datasets (>500 devices)
- Could add debouncing to filter slider for smoother UX
- DeviceMarker SVG could be memoized for better performance

These optimizations are not critical for current requirements but would improve scalability.

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during the review. The implementation is production-ready as submitted.

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/1.6-display-kismet-analysis-on-map.yml
Risk profile: Low risk - UI-only implementation with proper error handling
NFR assessment: All NFRs satisfied

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - All requirements met, tests passing, build successful
