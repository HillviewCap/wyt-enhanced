# **Introduction**

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the ISR Platform, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## **Starter Template or Existing Project**

The project will be built using a **Monorepo Tool (like Nx)**. This approach provides an excellent balance of control and pre-configured best practices, offering a flexible skeleton for our monorepo where we can set up the frontend and backend applications ourselves.
