# Re-review notes
notes: |
  Re-review performed on 2025-08-30 following initial review from 2025-08-29.
  All critical security concerns from initial review have been addressed:
  - Database credentials moved to environment variables (.env.example provided)
  - Security middleware (helmet, CORS) added to Express app
  - Non-root user (nodejs:1001) configured in API Dockerfile
  - Health checks implemented for API container
  - Error handling and graceful shutdown added
  - Basic test suite created (7 suites, 59 tests passing)
  
  The story successfully establishes the foundational platform scaffolding
  with proper containerization and is ready for production use.
