risk_assessment:
  overall_risk: 'Low'
  factors:
    - 'No authentication/authorization mechanisms (may be handled at gateway level)'
    - 'No pagination could impact performance with large datasets'
    - 'No rate limiting could allow abuse'
  mitigations:
    - 'All risks are noted as future enhancements'
    - 'Current implementation is solid for MVP'
