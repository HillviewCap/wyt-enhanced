# **Goals and Background Context**

## **Goals**

* **Drastically Simplify Deployment**: Reduce the median setup and deployment time for a functioning monitoring node to under 15 minutes.  
* **Enable Multi-Protocol Fusion**: Provide users the ability to ingest and visualize data from both Kismet (Wi-Fi/Bluetooth) and a basic SDR source on a single, correlated interface.  
* **Foster Community Adoption**: Launch a compelling open-source platform that achieves significant community traction, targeting 1,000 GitHub stars within the first year.  
* **Build an Extensible Foundation**: Create a modern, API-first architecture that can serve as the foundation for future enterprise features and broader community contributions.

## **Background Context**

Current open-source wireless intelligence tools are powerful but niche, hampered by severe limitations that prevent wider adoption. They are often restricted to a single protocol (like Wi-Fi), architected as monolithic desktop applications that cannot scale, and are notoriously difficult to install and configure, requiring hours of expert-level effort.

This project addresses this critical gap by creating a scalable, accessible, and integration-ready ISR platform. By leveraging a modern, containerized, cloud-native architecture, we will provide a solution that is easy to deploy, supports multi-protocol data fusion, and is built from the ground up with an API for extensibility.
