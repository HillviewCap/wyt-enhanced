# **User Interface Design Goals**

## **Overall UX Vision**

The user experience will be that of a professional, data-centric analytical tool. The design should prioritize function, clarity, and information density over aesthetic flair, enabling security analysts to quickly understand complex RF environments. The primary goal is to make fused, multi-protocol data intelligible and actionable at a glance.

## **Key Interaction Paradigms**

The core of the user experience will be a dynamic, interactive geospatial map. Key interactions will include:

* Panning and zooming the map to explore geographic areas.  
* Filtering the displayed data by protocol, time, signal strength, and persistence score.  
* Clicking on data points (representing devices or signals) to open a detailed information panel.  
* Utilizing a timeline control to play back, pause, and scrub through captured data chronologically.

## **Core Screens and Views**

Conceptually, the UI will be centered around these views:

* **Dashboard / Map View**: The main interface displaying the real-time or historical RF fusion map.  
* **Device Details View**: A side panel or modal providing all known metadata and historical activity for a selected device.  
* **Source Management View**: A simple settings page for configuring data sources (e.g., Kismet log paths, SDR settings) and managing API keys.

## **Accessibility: WCAG AA**

The application should be designed to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards to ensure it is usable by professionals with disabilities.

## **Branding**

Branding is to be determined. However, a "dark mode" theme with a high-contrast, professional color palette is recommended to reduce eye strain during long analysis sessions, which is common in SOC environments.

## **Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive**

The primary interface will be a responsive web application, ensuring functionality on both large desktop monitors for in-depth analysis and on tablets for potential field use.
