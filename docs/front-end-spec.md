# **ISR Platform UI/UX Specification**

## **Introduction**

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for the ISR Platform's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### **Overall UX Goals & Principles**

#### **Target User Personas**

We will design for the two personas defined in the PRD:

* **Primary: The Enterprise & Government Security Analyst**: Needs a powerful, data-dense, and efficient tool for professional operations.  
* **Secondary: The Independent Security Researcher**: Needs a capable but accessible and easy-to-navigate tool for individual use.

#### **Usability Goals**

* **Clarity**: Users must be able to understand complex, fused data at a glance.  
* **Efficiency**: Users should be able to perform core analysis tasks (e.g., filtering, investigating a device) with minimal clicks and cognitive load.  
* **Confidence**: The interface must feel reliable and professional, giving analysts high confidence in the data and their control over the tool.

#### **Design Principles**

1. **Clarity Above All**: Prioritize clear data visualization and straightforward controls. The user's focus should be on analysis, not on deciphering the interface.  
2. **Data-First, Action Second**: Always present the data clearly first, then provide contextual tools and actions that follow the user's natural analytical workflow.  
3. **Progressive Disclosure**: Reveal complexity as needed. The main dashboard will be clean and high-level, with intuitive options to drill down into details, preventing information overload.  
4. **Responsive & Performant**: The UI must be fast and fluid, even with large datasets. User interactions like filtering or panning the map must feel instantaneous.

## **Information Architecture (IA)**

### **Site Map / Screen Inventory**

This diagram shows the primary screens and their relationship for the MVP.  
`graph TD`  
    `A[App Entry / Dashboard] --> B[Map View];`  
    `A --> C[Device Details Panel];`  
    `A --> D[Filters Panel];`  
    `A --> E[Settings];`  
    `E --> F[Data Source Management];`  
    `E --> G[API Key Management];`

### **Navigation Structure**

* **Primary Navigation**: A persistent top navigation bar will be minimal, containing the application title/logo and a single icon or link to the "Settings" screen. The Dashboard/Map View is the default home screen and does not require a dedicated navigation link.  
* **Secondary Navigation**: Not required for the MVP due to the flat architecture.  
* **Breadcrumb Strategy**: Not required for the MVP.

\<hr\>

## **User Flows**

### **Flow 1: Initial Setup & First Analysis**

* **User Goal**: To configure a new data source (Kismet log) and see the initial analysis results on the map.  
* **Entry Points**: First launch of the application.  
* **Success Criteria**: The user successfully sees device data from their Kismet log plotted on the map.

**Flow Diagram**  
`graph TD`  
    `A[User opens app] --> B{Is a data source configured?};`  
    `B -->|No| C[User navigates to Settings];`  
    `C --> D[User adds Kismet log path & saves];`  
    `D --> E[User is directed back to Dashboard];`  
    `B -->|Yes| F[System ingests data];`  
    `E --> F;`  
    `F --> G{Ingestion successful?};`  
    `G -->|Yes| H[Device data is plotted on map];`  
    `G -->|No| I[Display error notification to user];`

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

* If the Kismet log path is invalid, the system should show a clear error message.  
* During ingestion, the UI should display a loading indicator to inform the user that processing is underway.

### **Flow 2: Investigating a High-Persistence Device**

* **User Goal**: To identify a high-threat device and examine its activity to determine if it is a risk.  
* **Entry Points**: Dashboard / Map View.  
* **Success Criteria**: The user can isolate a high-threat device, view its detailed information, and understand its activity pattern.

**Flow Diagram**  
`graph TD`  
    `A[User views map with multiple devices] --> B[User applies 'High Persistence' filter];`  
    `B --> C[Map updates to show only high-score devices];`  
    `C --> D[User clicks on a high-threat device marker];`  
    `D --> E[Device Details Panel opens with device info];`  
    `E --> F[User reviews device's score, locations, and timestamps];`  
    `F --> G[User closes panel to conclude investigation];`

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

* If no devices match the filter, the UI should display a "No results found" message.  
* If the details for a specific device fail to load, the details panel should show an appropriate error message.

## **Wireframes & Mockups**

### **Primary Design Files**

Detailed visual designs and high-fidelity mockups will be created and maintained in a dedicated design file (e.g., Figma). That file will be linked here once the foundational layout is approved.

### **Key Screen Layouts**

#### **Dashboard / Map View**

* **Purpose**: To provide the primary, unified view of all fused RF data on a geospatial map for real-time monitoring and analysis.  
* **Key Elements**:  
  * **Main Content Area**: A full-screen interactive map will dominate the view.  
  * **Top Navigation**: A thin, persistent bar at the top with the application title and a link to Settings.  
  * **Filters Panel**: A collapsible panel on the left side of the screen containing all controls for filtering the data on the map (e.g., by protocol, persistence score).  
  * **Details Panel**: A contextual panel or modal that appears when a user clicks a device on the map, displaying detailed information.  
  * **Timeline Control**: A control bar anchored to the bottom of the screen for playing back and scrubbing through time-series data.  
* **Interaction Notes**: The filters panel should update the map view in real-time. The details panel should appear as an overlay or in a dedicated portion of the screen without completely obscuring the map.  
* **Design File Reference**: *(To be created)*

## **Component Library / Design System**

### **Design System Approach**

For the MVP, we will leverage an existing, high-quality open-source component library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design, Shadcn/ui) to accelerate development. We will customize its theme (colors, typography, spacing) to align with our branding, rather than building a custom design system from scratch. This ensures accessibility and consistency while minimizing upfront effort.

### **Core Components**

Below are the foundational components needed to build the layouts we've discussed.

#### **Map View**

* **Purpose**: The primary component for displaying interactive geospatial data.  
* **Variants**: Live-data view, Historical-replay view.  
* **States**: Loading, Default (displaying data), Error, Empty.

#### **Filters Panel**

* **Purpose**: A collapsible container for all data filtering and UI controls.  
* **Variants**: N/A for MVP.  
* **States**: Collapsed, Expanded.

#### **Details Panel**

* **Purpose**: A contextual panel for displaying detailed information about a selected map entity.  
* **Variants**: N/A for MVP.  
* **States**: Loading, Displaying Data, Error.

#### **Button**

* **Purpose**: For all user-initiated actions.  
* **Variants**: Primary, Secondary, Ghost/Text.  
* **States**: Default, Hover, Disabled, Loading.

#### **Input Controls**

* **Purpose**: Used within the Filters Panel to control the data display.  
* **Variants**: Dropdown Select, Slider, Date/Time Picker.  
* **States**: Default, Focused, Disabled, Error.

## **Branding & Style Guide**

### **Visual Identity**

As a new project, a formal brand identity has not yet been established. This guide will serve as the foundational visual style. The aesthetic goal is **"Professional Clarity"**â€”a clean, modern, and highly legible interface that inspires confidence and focus. A dark theme will be the default.

### **Color Palette (Dark Theme)**

| Color Type | Hex Code | Usage |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Primary | \#EAEAEA | Main text, active indicators |
| Secondary | \#00BFFF | Interactive elements, links, highlights |
| Accent | \#FFD700 | High-priority alerts, selections |
| Success | \#2E7D32 | Positive feedback, confirmations |
| Warning | \#ED6C02 | Cautions, important notices |
| Error | \#D32F2F | Errors, destructive actions |
| Neutral | \#121212, \#1E1E1E | Page background, surface colors |

### **Typography**

* **Primary Font (UI & Text)**: **Inter**. A clean, highly legible sans-serif font designed for user interfaces.  
* **Monospace Font (Data & Code)**: **Roboto Mono**. For displaying technical data like MAC addresses and logs with clarity.  
* **Type Scale**: A standard responsive type scale will be used (e.g., H1: 2.5rem, H2: 2rem, Body: 1rem/16px).

### **Iconography**

* **Icon Library**: We will use a comprehensive, open-source library like **Feather Icons** or **Material Symbols** to ensure consistency and a clean, modern look.

### **Spacing & Layout**

* **Grid System**: An **8-point grid system** will be used. All spacing and sizing (padding, margins) will be in increments of 8px to ensure visual consistency and rhythm throughout the application.

\<hr\>

## **Accessibility Requirements**

### **Compliance Target**

* **Standard**: The application must meet the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA**.

### **Key Requirements**

**Visual:**

* **Color Contrast**: All text and meaningful UI elements must have a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 against their background. The proposed color palette was chosen with this in mind.  
* **Focus Indicators**: All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, map markers) must have a clearly visible focus indicator when navigated to via keyboard.  
* **Text Sizing**: Users must be able to resize text up to 200% in their browser without breaking the layout or losing functionality.

**Interaction:**

* **Keyboard Navigation**: All functionality must be operable through a keyboard alone. This includes navigating the map, selecting devices, and manipulating all filter controls.  
* **Screen Reader Support**: The application must be navigable and understandable with a screen reader. An alternative, accessible view of the map data (e.g., a sortable table) must be provided for screen reader users. ARIA attributes will be used to describe interactive components.  
* **Touch Targets**: On touch devices, all interactive targets must be at least 44x44 pixels to be easily tappable.

**Content:**

* **Form Labels**: All filter controls, settings inputs, and form fields must have clear, programmatically associated labels.  
* **Heading Structure**: The application will use a logical and semantic heading structure to define the page layout.

### **Testing Strategy**

Our testing approach will be a combination of automated scans using tools like Axe during development, supplemented with manual keyboard-only and screen reader testing on the two critical user flows we defined earlier.  
\<hr\>

## **Responsiveness Strategy**

### **Breakpoints**

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Target Devices |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Mobile | (default) | Smartphones |
| Tablet | 768px | Tablets |
| Desktop | 1024px | Laptops, Standard Monitors |
| Wide | 1440px | Large SOC Monitors |

### **Adaptation Patterns**

* **Layout Changes**: The core adaptation will affect the primary UI panels. On **Desktop/Wide** screens, the Filters Panel may be persistently visible as a sidebar. On **Tablet/Mobile**, the Filters Panel and Details Panel will function as overlays or drawers that can be toggled to maximize map visibility.  
* **Navigation Changes**: On **Mobile**, the link to the Settings page in the top navigation bar will collapse into a standard "hamburger" menu icon.  
* **Content Priority**: The **Map View** is always the highest priority element. On smaller screens, all other panels will be hidden by default to prioritize the map.  
* **Interaction Changes**: Hover-based interactions on Desktop will be replaced with explicit tap interactions on touch devices. All touch targets will be appropriately sized for mobile use.

\<hr\>

## **Animation & Micro-interactions**

### **Motion Principles**

Animation will be **subtle and functional**. Its purpose is to provide feedback, guide the user's focus, and improve perceived performance, not for decoration. All animations must be performant and will respect the prefers-reduced-motion accessibility setting.

### **Key Animations**

* **Panel Transitions**: Collapsible panels (Filters, Details) will use a smooth slide-in/slide-out transition.  
* **State Changes**: Buttons and controls will have subtle transitions for states like hover and focus.  
* **Loading Indicators**: We will use non-intrusive loading indicators (e.g., subtle spinners or progress bars) for asynchronous operations.

\<hr\>

## **Performance Considerations**

### **Performance Goals**

* **Initial Load**: The application with a standard dataset should achieve a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of under 3 seconds.  
* **Interaction Response**: All UI interactions (filtering, panning the map, opening panels) should provide feedback in under 100ms.

### **Design Strategies**

The design will support these goals by incorporating patterns like lazy loading for off-screen components and data virtualization for potentially long lists of devices.  
\<hr\>

## **Next Steps**

### **Immediate Actions**
